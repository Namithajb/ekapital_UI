								Get My Shopping is a customised "value added logistics service", which helps online shoppers around the world to buy online from "retailers in UK" who do not provide worldwide shipping and get the product delivered to anywhere in world to their own home.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are many online retailers in UK which provide quality products but do not provide international shipping for their purchases. We bridge this gap, by shipping these products using our custom online parcel service.
							</p>
							<p>
								This page attempts to explain this service in simple terms and provide all information to make your online purchases from a UK online retailer as smooth as possible.
							</p>
							
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<h4 style="color: darkblue;">How does "Get My Shopping" Service work?</h4>
							<p>
								"Get My Shopping" is a customized value added service which allows purchasers from outside UK to place their orders with UK based online retailers for their quality products.  We simply receive your ordered parcel and forward this as is - in original packaging to your delivery address+
