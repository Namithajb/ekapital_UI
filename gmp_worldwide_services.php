				<li>You will be required a print out of the shipping label to be attach to your parcel.</li>

				<li>Packages that exceed Courier weight and size limits are subject to an Oversize parcel charge</li>
				<li>Do ensure that your parcel does not contain any items mentioned under "<a href="prohibiteditemstandc.gmp" target="_blank">Prohibited items list</a>".</li>
