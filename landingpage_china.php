</p><p>
We understand the importance and urgency of documents, such as visa application, bank statements and are quite experienced in delivering them. For the past several years we have been handling the courier shipments many Chinan expats from the UK to China and other countries. GetMyParcel are sure if given an opportunity, we will be able to provide you with our excellent service.
</p><p>
The up to date status of the shipments sent through us can be tracked on our website. We can arrange collection from your office at a mutually convenient time.

We will offer a tailor made service for your parcel detail. Since non-document parcel to China requires customs paper and KYC documents, we can help with information regarding customs paper works required.

 </p><p>

We regularly update with Customs procedure and latest regulation in China. However  it is the receiver's responsibility to deal with customs duties when delivering goods there. With our office in China we can help the receiver with customs update and other information regarding the customs clearance.
