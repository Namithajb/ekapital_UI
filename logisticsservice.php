						  <p>As your customers order products with you, either via your website (or) by any other route, they can be presented with a list of courier service options by your customer support - based on the destination country & considered weight of the product, usually towards the end of the order - to confirm on their shipping preferences.</p>

						  	<li>This can either be provided as realtime (by making your Business Solutions talk to GetMyParcel’s Business portal APIs) - or - in a stored rates provided by us, whichever works out best for your business.</li>
						  </ul>
