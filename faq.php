          </div>

          <h3>Why are there different services available to different countries or postcodes?</h3><div>
            <p>Each postcode can have a different delivery time, different collection cut off time and different service availability. When you enter your shipment information in the Quick quote,it will show you the available services and transit times for that particular destination.</p>

          </div>

          <h3>Can Parcel collection be done same day?</h3><div>
            <p>Yes however it must be within the collection cut of time for your area. A <a href="/">Quick quote</a> will always present all the available collection and delivery options to you, so if there is a same day collection available at the time you do the quick quote, and will give you that option.</p>

          </div>

          <h3>Why do the surcharges change and how do I work them out?</h3><div>
            <p>Surcharges are dependent on the type of shipment you send. There are surcharges for large items or deliveries to remote areas. Refer - what is a remote area surcharge question below.</p>

          </div>

          <h3>What surcharges can be added to my shipment after I have sent it that is not included in my quote?</h3><div>
            <p>If you misdeclare the dimensions of your parcel then the following charges may be applied:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mis declaration - administration charge
              <li>Special Handling
              <li>Over limit Fee (If the parcel is oversize)
            </ul>
            <p>
              If there is a problem with delivery, the following surcharges may be applied:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Undeliverable Shipments
              <li>Address Correction
              <li>Storage
            </ul>
            </p>

          </div>

          <h3>What is Remote Area Surcharge?</h3><div>
            <p>A surcharge is applied per shipment when the delivery destination location is remote. Remote is defined as islands and highlands; or a post code/zip code that is difficult to serve; or a suburb/town that is distant, inaccessible or infrequently served. This list changes from carrier to carrier and involves a cost. This is applicable for both - Pickup and Delivery. <br/><br/>

              This amount / surcharge is not shown on the GetMyParcel.com website while order is placed. If applicable, this information will be provided to you by our customer service after an order is placed either by phone or via email. This cost is to be borne by the customer. Payment can be made for this amount separately as advised by our customer services team at that point in time. Do note that, you can always decide to not continue with the order (subject to GetMyParcel.com terms and conditions) if you choose to based on the remote area surcharge amount communicated.</p>

            <p>Refer our Terms and Conditions for more information on Surcharges.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>What is volumetric weight and how can I work it out?</h3><div>
            <p>A parcel is billed on either its physical weight or volumetric weight, whichever is the great. When you enter the dimensions of each parcel, GetMyParcel.com automatically calculates the volumetric weight for you. You can also use our <a href="/">volumetric weight calculator</a> on home page in the quote box.</p>

          </div>


          <h3>What happens if I make a mistake when entering the volumes or weight?</h3><div>
            <p>If you enter the wrong information when creating a shipment, then the price will change. If we have to adjust the price of your shipment due to in-accuracies in the weight or dimensions, there is an administration charge of �5. Please see our additional surcharges information in this FAQ for more information.</p>

          </div>


          <h3>What additional documentation is required?</h3><div>
            <p>There will normally be two labels produced for each package. The main copy goes on each package and the space label, known as the 'archive label' is given separately to the driver. In addition for each shipment there is also a manifest printed, which should be signed by the driver upon collection. This is your proof of shipping. If you don't get your manifest signed then you may be unable to claim for your goods if they are lost.</p>

          </div>

            <p>The driver will always attempt to collect during the requested time slot where possible. The time slot however is only a request and should the driver not be able to collect during this period they could attempt outside of this slot between the hours of 9 � 5.30pm.The driver would always rather attempt than not attempt at all if they cannot collect during the requested time slot, but we really do get very few issues of this nature as the time slots displayed are supplied by the carrier knowing when the driver is due to be in your area.</p>

          </div>
