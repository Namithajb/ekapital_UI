						<p> Get My Parcel gives you the freedom to ship almost everything you would typically find in a standard holiday suitcase.

					  <h3 class="heading"><strong>Few most commonly asked questions</strong></h3>
					</div>
                    <br/>
						<h4 style="color: darkblue;">I am an Expat and want to Ship my contents back to UK. How can I get my luggage back?</h4>
						<p>This is a common scenario that we deal with.</p>
						<p>The first step is to get the material packed (or at least have a clear idea on how many boxes will be there), then raise an order with GetMyParcel.com, get the documentation ready as advised by GetMyParcel, followed by completing the packing. There are two options to pack your parcels - 
                        <ul>
                        <li> the most ideal one being - you pack it yourself /or/ get it packed locally to keep your parcel ready for collection by us. This is important to ensure that someone whom you trust is packing your materials and is not left to strangers.
                        <li> The second option - is that we can identify a vendor locally to get this packed on your behalf, you will need to be present to open the door and guide on packing (which one goes in which box etc). This is subject to we being able to find a local packing vendor (or) us already having a pre-approved vendor. 
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>NOTE: DO note that - immaterial of who packs the contents, as the owner of the contents, you have full responsibility for the contents of the luggage / parcel.</b></p>
                        <p>Your Order will be collected by our shipping agents on the pre-agreed date with GetMyParcel and delivered to the destination address.</p>
						<p><small>@ Subject to Customs Duty and other charges at the destination port. </small></p>
                    <br/>
						<h4 style="color: darkblue;">I am an Expat and have already reached back UK, but my belongings are still in third country which my friend's /colleagues can provide access to. How can I get my luggage back?</h4>
						<p>This is a common scenario that we deal with. There are few additional conditions that are applicable for this case.</p>
						<p>As you are already in your home country, you have to raise a order with GetMyParcel.com and pass on the message to your Friend / Colleague who can help us in the third country. There are two options to pack your parcels - 
                        <ul>
                        <li> the most ideal one being - your friend / colleague will package it themselves / get it packaged locally to keep your parcel ready for collection by us. This is important to ensure that someone whom you trust is packing your materials and is not left to strangers.
                        <li> The second option - is that we can cordinate with someone locally to get this packaged on your behalf, again your friend/ colleague will need to be present to open the door and guide on packing (which one goes in which box etc). This is subject to we being able to find a local packing vendor (or) us already having a pre-approved vendor. Either ways, this second option is not the most preferred one.
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p><b>NOTE: DO note that - immaterial of who packs the contents, as the owner of the contents, you have full responsibility for the contents of the luggage / parcel.</b></p>
                        <p>Your Order will be collected by our agents on the pre-agreed date with GetMyParcel and delivered to the destination address.</p>
						<p><small>@ Subject to Customs Duty and other charges at the destination port. </small></p>
					<br/>
						<h4 style="color: darkblue;">I have already relocated to my home country and my belongings are in the UK with my friend's / colleagues house. How is this process different in this case?</h4>
						<p>This again is a common scenario that we deal with commonly. There are few additional conditions that are applicable for this case.</p>
						<p>As you are already in your home country, you have to raise a order with GetMyParcel.com. Ideally, your parcel should reach your home country /destination within 15 days of your arrival. Your friend / colleague will have to keep your parcel ready for collection. Do note that your luggage should be packaged by yourself before leaving UK. Shipment will be delivered at your doorstep (/ destination address in order) after completion of customs procedures@. </p>
                        <p><b>NOTE: DO note that Immaterial of who packs the contents, as the owner of the contents, you have full responsibility for the contents of the luggage / parcel.</b></p>
						<p><small>@ Subject to Customs Duty and other charges at the destination port. </small></p>
					<br/><br/>
						<h4 style="color: darkblue;"> I am relocating from UK, and don't have address in destination city where I have to send my baggage. How can I send my belongings so that I can reach there and collect the same ?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Basic Rule : You can only send a parcel to a person who has a "address" in destination city.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>For e.g. if you are sending a parcel to India, this is enforced by Indian Customs, by having to provide a KYC - Know your customer - documents in India. This includes the ID proof and Address proof - of the person to whom you are addressing your parcel.</li>
									<li>For other countries, this rule might be slightly different.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>In other words, if you still do not have a address to the city you are travelling to, then you cannot send the parcel anonymously (or) in your name without a address proof.</li>
							<li><b>So what should I do ?</b>
								<ul><li>This is again a common scenario, so we recommend that you <a href="contactUs.gmp">get in touch with our customer service</a>, and we will be able to advise you appropriately.</li></ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
	
					<br/><br/>	
						<h4 style="color: darkblue;"> Can I send any fragile items? </h4>
						<p>We recommend that all fragile goods should be packed by a professional packing agent, and all the packing has to be airworthy.Please do <a href="contactUs.gmp">get in touch with our customer service</a></p> before sending any such parcels. For valuable items, we do recommend considering insuring the parcel. Also, do go through <a href="prohibiteditemstandc.gmp">Prohibited items terms and conditions</a> to verify about any items that cannot be sent via courier services.
