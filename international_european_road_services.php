            <ul class="list-unstyled list-custom">
				<li>You will be required a print out of the shipping label to be attach to your parcel.</li>
				<li>Shipment will be charged by either actual weight or volumetric weight – whichever is greater. Volumetric weight is a value derived from the size rather than the weight of your parcel and may apply if your parcel is particularly large and contains relatively light items.</li>
				<li>Volumetric weight is calculated by multiplying the three dimensions, ( Height x Length x Width in cms ) and dividing by 5000.</li>
				<li>Packages that exceed Courier weight and size limits are subject to an Oversize parcel charge</li>
				<li>Do ensure that your parcel does not contain any items mentioned under "<a href="prohibitedItemsTermsAndConditions.php" target="_blank">Prohibited items list</a>".</li>
				<li>Customs invoice is required for all non-documents going outside EEC countries (for  worldwide services)</li>
